Liu in his book Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves, define immersions as the composite of an open immersion followed by a closed immersion. These immersions are immersions in the sense above, but the converse is false. Furthermore, under this definition, the composite of two immersions is not necessarily an immersion. However, the two definitions are equivalent when f is quasi-compact.[16] Note that an open immersion is completely described by its image in the sense of topological spaces, while a closed immersion is not: \n  \n    \n      \n        Spec\n        \u2061\n        A\n        \n          /\n        \n        I\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spec} A/I}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        Spec\n        \u2061\n        A\n        \n          /\n        \n        J\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {Spec} A/J}\n  \n may be homeomorphic but not isomorphic. This happens, for example, if I is the radical of J but J is not a radical ideal. When specifying a closed subset of a scheme without mentioning the scheme structure, usually the so-called reduced scheme structure is meant, that is, the scheme structure corresponding to the unique radical ideal consisting of all functions vanishing on that closed subset.",

It is usually the case that is enough to check one cover, not all possible ones. One also says that a certain property is Zariski-local, if one needs to distinguish between the Zariski topology and other possible topologies, like the \u00e9tale topology. Consider a scheme X and a cover by affine open subschemes Spec Ai. Using the dictionary between (commutative) rings and affine schemes local properties are thus properties of the rings Ai. A property P is local in the above sense, iff the corresponding property of rings is stable under localization. For example, we can speak of locally Noetherian schemes, namely those which are covered by the spectra of Noetherian rings. The fact that localizations of a Noetherian ring are still noetherian then means that the property of a scheme of being locally Noetherian is local in the above sense (whence the name). Another example: if a ring is reduced (i.e., has no non-zero nilpotent elements), then so are its localizations. An example for a non-local property is separatedness (see below for the definition). Any affine scheme is separated, therefore any scheme is locally separated. However, the affine pieces may glue together pathologically to yield a non-separated scheme. The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of local properties of rings, which are applied to schemes.

The \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n  \n-valued points are thought of, via Yoneda's lemma, as a way of identifying \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n with the representable functor \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          h\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h_{S}}\n  \n it sets up. Historically there was a process by which projective geometry added more points (e.g. complex points, line at infinity) to simplify the geometry by refining the basic objects. The \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n  \n-valued points were a massive further step. As part of the predominating Grothendieck approach, there are three corresponding notions of fiber of a morphism: the first being the simple inverse image of a point. The other two are formed by creating fiber products of two morphisms. For example, a geometric fiber of a morphism \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n            \u2032\n          \n        \n        \u2192\n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S^{\\prime }\\to S}\n  \n is thought of as\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n            \u2032\n          \n        \n        \n          \u00d7\n          \n            S\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Spec\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          \n            K\n            \u00af\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S^{\\prime }\\times _{S}{\\textrm {Spec}}({\\overline {K}})}\n  \n.\n\nThis makes the extension from affine schemes, where it is just the tensor product of R-algebras, to all schemes of the fiber product operation a significant (if technically anodyne) result.",
