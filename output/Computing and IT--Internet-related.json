ADSL is asymmetric in the sense that it uses most of the channel to transmit downstream to the user and only a small part to receive information from the user. This means, high download rates and slower upload rates. Generally if you see 2Mb ADSL broadband, it refers to 2 Mbit/s Max d/load rate. The upload rate will probably be around 256 kbit/s Max. (ADSL has a maximum download rate of 8 Mbit/s, ADSL2 is capable of up to 16 Mbit/s and ADSL2+ is rated at 24 Mbit/s maximum.)",
