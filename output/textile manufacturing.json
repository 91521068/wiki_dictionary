When the wires are extracted the warp ends that have been woven over the wires remain as loops on top of the fabric or will form cut pile if the wire is equipped with a cutting blade. This technique is also known as \"\u00e9pingl\u00e9 weaving\". A wire loom in a much wider version (up to 5 meters of width) and in heavier construction is used for the manufacturing of carpets is called a \"WILTON\" loom, and the carpets made on such a loom are known as \"Wilton Carpets\"",
