The noun is abominatio, from which English \"abomination\" derives. At the taking of formally solicited auspices (auspicia impetrativa), the observer was required to acknowledge any potentially bad sign occurring within the templum he was observing, regardless of the interpretation.[2] He might, however, take certain actions in order to ignore the signa, including avoiding the sight of them, and interpreting them as favourable. The latter tactic required promptness, wit and skill based on discipline and learning.[3] Thus the omen had no validity apart from the observation of it.[4]",

It seems the sacrality of the function the tribune had already been established in earlier times through a religio and a sacramentum,[503] however it obliged only the contracting parties. In order to become a rule that obliged everybody it had to be sanctioned through a sanctio that was not only civil but religious as well: the trespasser was to be declared sacer, his family and property sold.[504] Sacer would thus design the religious compact, sanctus the law. According to other passages in Livy, the law was not approved by some jurists of the time who maintained that only those who infringed the commonly recognised divine laws (id (or Iovi corr. Mueller) sacrum sanciti) could fall into the category of those to be declared sacri. In fact in other places Livy states that only the potestas and not the person of the tribune was defined as sacrosancta.[505] The word is used in Livy III 19, 10 by the critics of the law in this way: \"These people postulate they themselves should be sacrosancti, they who do not hold even gods for sacred and saint?\"[506]",

Thence sancio would mean to render something sacer, i.e. belonging to the gods in the sense of having their guarantee and protection.[507] Some think it is a derivation from the theonym Sancus, the god of the ratification of foedera and protection of good faith, from the root sancu- plus suffix -io as inquio>incio.[508] In such case the verb would mean an act that reflects or conforms to the function of this god, i.e. the ratifying and guaranteeing compacts.",

It is connected to the name of the Umbrian or Sabine founder-deity Sancus (in Umbrian Sancius) whose most noted function was the ratifying and protecting of compacts (foedera).[509] The Roman jurist Ulpian distinguishes sanctus as \"neither sacred (sacer) nor profane (profanum) ... nor religiosus.\"[510] Gaius writes that a building dedicated to a god is sacrum, a town's wall and gate are res sanctae because they belong \"in some way\" to divine law, and a graveyard is religiosus because it is relinquished to the di Manes.
