This time period would be characterized by unrest, strife, famine, and other, natural disasters.\nThe three periods and the five five-hundred year periods are described in the Sutra of the Great Assembly (\u5927\u96c6\u7d4c Cn: d\u00e0j\u00ed j\u012bng; Jp: Daishutu-ky\u014d, Daijuku-ky\u014d, Daijikky\u014d, or Daishukky\u014d).
