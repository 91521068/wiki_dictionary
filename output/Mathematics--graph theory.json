Walks are also sometimes called chains.[10] A walk is open if its starts and ends at two different vertices, and closed if it starts and ends at the same vertex. A closed walk may also be called a cycle. Alternatively, the word \"cycle\" may be reserved for a simple closed walk (one without repeated vertices or edges except for the repetition of the starting and final vertex). A walk without repeated edges (but with vertex repetition allowed) may be called a trail and a closed trail may be called a tour. In the context of ear decomposition, a walk that can have the same starting and ending vertex but otherwise avoids any repeated vertices may be called an ear.",
