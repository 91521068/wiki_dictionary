(This is Heidegger's usual reading of aletheia as Unverborgenheit, \"unconcealment.\")[3] It is closely related to the notion of world disclosure, the way in which things get their sense as part of a holistically structured, pre-interpreted background of meaning. Initially, Heidegger wanted aletheia to stand for a re-interpreted definition of truth. However, he later corrected the association of aletheia with truth (see main article on aletheia for more information).",

It is provided by dread or death. In the analysis of time, it is revealed as a threefold condition of Being. Time, the present and the notion of the \"eternal\", are modes of temporality. Temporality is the way we see time. For Heidegger, it is very different from the mistaken view of time as being a linear series of past, present and future. Instead he sees it as being an ecstasy, an outside-of-itself, of futural projections (possibilities) and one's place in history as a part of one's generation. Possibilities, then, are integral to our understanding of time; our projects, or thrown projection in-the-world, are what absorb and direct us. Futurity, as a direction toward the future that always contains the past\u2014the has-been\u2014is a primary mode of Dasein's temporality.",

Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) \"ultrasocial\"[9] and \"obligatorily gregarious.\"[10] Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life \"Being-with\" (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human.[11] We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.",

            "def": "Dasein is a German word and is sometimes translated as \"being-there\" or \"being-here\" (da combines in its meaning \"here\" and \"there\", excluding the spatial-relational distinction made by the English words; Sein is the infinitive, \"to be\"). It is the German form of the existential expletive, which, as in most European languages, is expressed idiomatically. Heidegger, after Nietzsche, used the word, but as a gerund synonym for \"human being\" or \"human entity.\" A Dasein is then a new coinage for a being that is there, in a familiar world, and in a mood. Dasein also has unique capacities for language, intersubjective communication, and detached reasoning. Heidegger does not want to get tied up with overused and ambiguous words such as \"person,\" \"consciousness,\" \"soul,\" or \"spirit,\" so Dasein is a new way of approaching something all of those other words point towards, but without the connotations. Dasein is the starting point of Heidegger's ontology. It is typically thought to apply to humans, but it could apply to any being that fulfills the definition's characteristics which he states. What makes a being a Dasein is as follows: Dasein is a being whose being is an issue for itself; every Dasein has an a priori sense of \"mineness,\" or being one's self; Dasein is always thrown into the world, meaning it finds itself within a world, meaning no Dasein has ever been decontextualized. We are all world-bound, submerged, entangled, and engaged with our ontico-ontological surroundings through care, concern, and moods. Dasein has various modes of being-in-the-world, which are the subject of much of Heidegger's analysis in Being and Time. Furthermore, average humans have a pre-ontological (general intuitive sense of being) understanding of being insofar as they understand what things are and that they are e.g. \"My dog is brown\" or \"Today is Sunday.\" Heidegger believed that this pre-reflective understanding of being, that which determines entities as entities,[16] helps constitute our unique existence as human beings, thus the coinage of \"Dasein.\"",
