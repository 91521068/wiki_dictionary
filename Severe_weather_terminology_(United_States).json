This type of warning was initially issued only by National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices in Wichita and Topeka, Kansas, and Springfield, St. Louis and Kansas City/Pleasant Hill, Missouri; it was expanded to include 33 additional National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices within the Central Region Headquarters in 2013, and then to eight additional offices within the Eastern, Southern and Western Regions in the spring of 2014.[4]\nTornado Emergency \u2013 Sent as a \"severe weather statement\" or a complete re-issuance of the tornado warning, this is an unofficial, high-end tornado warning issued when a violent tornado is expected to impact a heavily populated area. Such warnings have been issued for the F5-rated 1999 Bridge Creek\u2013Moore tornado; the EF5 tornado that destroyed much of Greensburg, Kansas on May 4, 2007; the EF4 tornado that hit Tuscaloosa, Alabama on April 27, 2011; the EF5 tornado that affected southern portions of the Oklahoma City area but mostly affected Moore on May 20, 2013; and the May 31, 2013 tornado system that went over the Oklahoma City area through an extremely densely populated area. This enhanced form of a tornado warning is issued mainly by Weather Forecast Offices within the National Weather Service's Central and Southern Region Headquarters; a tornado emergency is the highest level of a three-tiered Impact Based Warning system for tornadoes used by all WFOs within the Central Region Headquarters, and eight others within the Eastern, Southern and Western Regions.[4]\n\n",
