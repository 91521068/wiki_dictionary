Since in these dances the follower's right arm is normally used to lead a turn (most commonly by the leader's left arm, but sometimes by the leader's right arm when a cross-hand or \"handshake\" position is used), an inside turn is normally a left (counter-clockwise) turn, while an outside turn is a right (clockwise) turn.
