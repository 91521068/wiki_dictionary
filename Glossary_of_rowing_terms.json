In head races, where boats do not race next to each other, there is a running start, where rowing begins before the starting line and rowers are already at full speed when they cross the start. In sprints (head-to-head), the start consists of the following sections:\n\nActual start: This is generally five or six partial strokes done at a high rate and in a certain pattern, i.e. some three-quarter length strokes (sometimes called three-quarters slide, or \"draws\"), followed by half strokes (\"winds\"), which are then lengthened into full length strokes. The goal is to get the rowers off to a cohesive start and quickly build momentum, with the rate of the draws being held by the subsequent lengthens. In the draws, it is important to grip the water gently at first and not to \"rip\", causing turbulence and not transmitting energy effectively. An example start, called by the coxwain, would go as such: \"Draw....there! Draw....there! Wind one! Wind two! Wind three! Lengthen it out....Lengthen....Lengthen\". The tone, pitch and rhythm of the cox's voice helps to guide the crew as to what is required.\nHigh Ten: A set of strokes done at a high cadence immediately after the start. Not to be confused with \"Power Ten,\" the high ten is ten strokes at a high rating to finish building speed. Some crews may pull fifteen or twenty high strokes to build even more speed.\nSettle: Immediately after the rowers complete their high cadence strokes, the stroke tempo is lowered and the stroke lengthened to the rating to be used throughout the body of the race. Often accompanied by a Power 10 or 20. Coxswains may call a \"Ten to Settle\" or \"Ten to Glide\" to drop the cadence more gradually.\n\n",
